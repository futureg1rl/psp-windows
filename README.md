// Archived by FUTUREGIRL - Im using MS DOS - BORLAND TURBO to edit & recompile

// The Original DosBox + DBS 2C - Created by CrazyC and Gaby_64. I take 0 credit for the development of this. Its just a bitch to find, and i would like people to see it and be able to use it. Original page is below, and creator credits are here. I have permission from the creator to post this. Hopefully we can improve this, and optimise for the VITA!

// INFO

	- You will have to source your own IMG files, as unfortunately it is illegal to distribute these. 
 	  It should not be too hard for you to find them. As a starting point for 95 and 3.1, 
 	  Archive.org is a great place. As for 98, all i can say is, go look for the Wii.


// CHANGELOG 

	- I will work through the things in her To-Do list, until they are all completed. 
 	  For now, i'm fixing some graphical errors and spelling stuff. 
 	  The video took me too long and i want to post it first, maybe then i can get some
	  help from someone too.) I used MS DOS - BORLAND TURBO to recompile

	- align menu titles properly
	- align all titles properly
	- fix spelling errors

// INSTALL

	Copy your Windows IMG Files over to the Dosbox folder in this package. 
	- Rename Windows 3.1 to W31
	- Rename Windows 95 to W95
	- Rename Windows 98 to W98

	(FOR VITA) -place the Dosbox folder into - \pspemu\PSP\GAME\DOSBox
	(FOR PSP) - place the Dosbox folder into - \PSP\GAME\DOSBox
	
	- then just run the Dosbox app, and use the keybinds listed below to launch whichever OS you want.
